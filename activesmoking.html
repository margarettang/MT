  <h1>Active Smoking</h1>
  <p>Cigarette smoking is hazardous to health. Almost everyone knows that smoking can cause lung cancer in smokers.
But most people have very little idea of exactly how dangerous smoking can be, how many different types of diseases it can cause or complicate, or how much smoking increases the risk of contracting various deadly diseases.</p>
  <h3>Cancers</h3>
  <p>The principal substances causing cancer are found in the "tar." And smoking is also responsible for many other types of cancers, many of which prove fatal:</p>
    <h5>cancers of the mouth and throat</h5> 
    <h5>lung cancer</h5>
    <h5>oesophageal cancer</h5>
    <h5> bladder and kidney cancer</h5>
    <h5> pancreatic cancer</h5>
    <h5> stomach cancer</h5>
    <h5> liver cancer</h5>
    <h5> cervical cancer</h5>
    <h5> leukaemia</h5>
  <p> A smoker increases the risk of getting lung cancer by 900 percent (10 times), and a heavy smoker increases the risk over 1400 percent (15-25 times the risk). </p>
  
  <h3>Cardiac Diseases</h3>
  <p>
    Two immediate effects of smoking on heart and circulation are increase in your heartbeat rate and  sharp rise in blood pressure.
    These responses are caused by nicotine which acts on the nervous system, causing the heart rate to rise and blood vessels to constrict. This narrowing of the blood vessels causes the blood pressure rise and strain is put on the heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    The carbon monoxide in cigarettes depletes the oxygen carrying capacity of a smoker's blood. This means that the heart has to pump harder to get enough oxygen to the rest of the body.
  </p>
  <p>
    Smoking can also affect the blood in the long term: increase in the blood cholesterol and fibrinogen levels. Both these factors mean blood will clot more easily and this will increase the risk of having a heart attack, caused by a blood clot forming in the heart
  </p>
  <p>
    The heart and circulation attacks caused by smoking include : Coronary heart disease (CHD), Aneurysm, Peripheral vascular disease (PVD), stroke etc.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Pulmonary and Respiratory Diseases</h3>
  <p>
    Smoking causes the accumulation of harmful substances inside the bronchial tubes. The obstruction of small airways in the lung prevents inhaled air from exit, leading to final rupture of the air sacs, causing breathing difficulties. This disease is called emphysema. Patients need to use breathing mask because most lung cells are damaged.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other common smoking related disease is chronic bronchitis, which has similar symptoms as emphysema.
